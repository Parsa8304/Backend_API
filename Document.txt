______________________________________________________________________
Apps:
This project contains 2 apps (formlogin_app , user_app), which are
connected to each other through the settings.py and different modules throughout the project.

modules such as: models.py , views.py , urls,py , serializers.py.


----> user_app:
This app only contains the CutomUser models and its children(Seller, Investor , Gamer).
in the api directory, you can see the views for registration and logout actions , however
for the login process I have used the JWT authentication .

you can also have access the urls of this app through the 'accounts/some other url'
The serializers.py is only used for registration as we don't need to use or implement the custom login
process(we use JWT)



---->formlogin_app:
 This app performs the CRUD operations for the onlineshops and products

 There is also a permision.py file as limits the access to the urls and views,
 e.g. you cant create an online shop if you are not a Seller.Or you can't see the user list if you are not
 the admin ..
